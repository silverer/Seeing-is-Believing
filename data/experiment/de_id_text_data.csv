Essentially, tumors and cancers prevent one's immune system from combating the cancer/tumor, allowing it grow. However, by taking another disease that the body recognizes and removing its infectious components and then transplanting it at the site of the cancer/tumor, the body's immune system can attack the implanted disease and consequently the cancer/tumor. Because the body's response is localized, the side effects are controlled. This method has thus far yielded positive results in mice and could potentially be used to treat people.

They are as much as 8000 times more resistant than other species of fish. The Atlantic Killfish's ability to survive in these conditions is attributed to quick evolution. It was found that they were able to evolve so quickly due to their extremely high level of genetic variation. This may seem positive, but most important species are not able to adapt as quickly to survive the changes humans are inflicting on the environment. By studying the genome of Atlantic Killfish, researchers found the particular genes responsible for pollution tolerance.

While STEM majors are stupid, this survey is not proof of that in any way. I do not consent to the release of my answers to this survey. I retract any consent that was given initially. I have the right to do so. I think this study was meant to see how long a survey can be before people really just stop caring.

She found that there weren't major differences between the genomes of the fish from polluted populations vs. non-polluted populations, therefore, the fish must have had genetic variation prior to being spurred into a polluted environment. However, though killifish have been able to adapt and use natural selection to their advantage, other species of fish that we want alive don't have as much genetic variation already in their genome. As a result, they are at higher risks of extinction compared to killifish as genetic variation is a major contributor to species survival. Hopefully, by studying how chemicals from pollution affect other vertebrate animals, Davis hopes to get insights into how those same chemicals may affect humans.

The study tested four bodies of water and found that the fish all evolved in a similar way suggesting there are only a few ways the Killifish may be able to adapt to the pollution. The reason for the adaptation is that the fish have the highest genetic variation of any vertebrae, allowing the fish with traits that give them the ability to survive in such levels of pollution to pass on their genes. The article states that although this sounds like good news that nature can now survive regardless of the pollution, it reassures that most animals that people care about would not survive the pollution due to lack of genetic variation. The article ends with how studying the genetic variation of the fish and its relation with pollution can give insight into how humans are affected by the pollutants.",3.09,3.09,9.407,1,mitochondria,99.965,99.965,99.969,1,,7.242,50.491,50.495,7,,6.386,33.893,33.896,4,,7.349,43.679,48.104,8,experiment,19.621,19.621,19.624,1,,42.413,42.413,42.416,1,,36.473,36.473,36.477,1,,3.641,16.389,51.131,9,alcaline,5.511,72.713,77.278,5,microscope,13.168,112.562,147.796,7,"1.
